      <p>Texas presents unique roofing challenges that require careful material selection and maintenance strategies. With scorching summers, occasional hail storms, and high UV exposure, your roof needs to be built to withstand the extremes of the Lone Star State.</p>

      <h2>Understanding Texas Climate Challenges</h2>
      <p>Texas roofs face intense sun exposure for 6-8 months per year, with temperatures regularly exceeding 100°F. UV radiation degrades roofing materials faster here than in northern states, reducing the expected lifespan of most roofing products by 15-25%.</p>
      
      <p>Additionally, the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex experiences an average of 3-5 severe hail events per year, with hailstones ranging from quarter-sized to golf ball-sized. This makes impact resistance a critical factor in material selection.</p>

      <h2>Best Roofing Materials for Texas</h2>
      
      <h3>Architectural Asphalt Shingles (Top Choice)</h3>
      <p>Over 75% of Texas homes use architectural asphalt shingles, and for good reason. They offer the best balance of cost, performance, and aesthetic appeal for our climate.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Price:</strong> $4.50-6.00 per sq ft installed</li>
        <li><strong>Lifespan:</strong> 20-25 years in Texas heat (vs 30 years in cooler climates)</li>
        <li><strong>Impact Resistance:</strong> Class 4 options available for hail protection</li>
        <li><strong>Color Options:</strong> Choose lighter colors to reflect heat and reduce cooling costs</li>
        <li><strong>Wind Rating:</strong> 110-130 mph varieties protect against severe storms</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Metal Roofing (Premium Performance)</h3>
      <p>Metal roofing is gaining popularity in Texas due to superior heat reflection and longevity. Standing seam metal roofs can reduce cooling costs by 20-30% compared to dark asphalt shingles.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Price:</strong> $9.00-14.00 per sq ft installed</li>
        <li><strong>Lifespan:</strong> 40-70 years with minimal maintenance</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Cool metal roofing qualifies for energy tax credits</li>
        <li><strong>Hail Rating:</strong> Excellent resistance, though aluminum may dent with large hail</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Clay/Concrete Tile (Luxury Option)</h3>
      <p>Popular in San Antonio and Austin for Spanish-style homes, tile roofing excels in Texas heat but requires structural reinforcement due to weight.</p>

      <h2>Critical Features for Texas Roofs</h2>
      
      <h3>Impact Resistance Rating</h3>
      <p>Look for Class 4 impact-rated shingles, especially if you're in the "Hail Alley" corridor from San Antonio through Dallas to Wichita Falls. Many insurance companies offer 15-30% premium discounts for impact-resistant roofing.</p>

      <h3>Cool Roofing Technology</h3>
      <p>Reflective roofing can reduce surface temperatures by 50-60°F. The Texas State Energy Conservation Office reports that cool roofs can reduce annual cooling costs by $150-300 for the average home.</p>

      <h3>Wind Resistance</h3>
      <p>With wind speeds reaching 70-90 mph during severe storms (and occasionally higher with tornadoes), choose shingles rated for at least 110 mph winds.</p>

      <h2>Installation Best Practices</h2>
      <p>Texas heat affects installation quality. Shingles installed during 100°F+ weather can seal too quickly or become brittle. Professional contractors should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Install during cooler morning hours (below 85°F when possible)</li>
        <li>Use proper ventilation systems (ridge vents, soffit vents) to reduce attic temps</li>
        <li>Apply ice and water shield even though Texas rarely sees ice (protects against wind-driven rain)</li>
        <li>Use high-quality underlayment rated for Texas heat</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Maintenance Requirements</h2>
      <p>Annual inspections are crucial in Texas. Schedule them in spring (after winter storms) and fall (before winter). Look for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Granule loss from UV exposure (shingles becoming smooth/shiny)</li>
        <li>Cracked or curled shingles from heat cycling</li>
        <li>Hail damage (circular dents, displaced granules)</li>
        <li>Loose or damaged flashing around chimneys and vents</li>
        <li>Debris accumulation in valleys</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Cost Considerations</h2>
      <p>Texas roof replacement costs vary by region:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>DFW Metroplex:</strong> $7,000-15,000 for average 2,000 sq ft home</li>
        <li><strong>Houston:</strong> $6,500-14,000 (higher humidity requires premium underlayment)</li>
        <li><strong>San Antonio/Austin:</strong> $7,500-16,000 (tile roofing more common, higher costs)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Insurance Claims & Hail Damage</h2>
      <p>Texas law gives you 2 years from the date of damage to file an insurance claim. If you suspect hail damage:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Document damage with photos and videos</li>
        <li>Get a professional inspection (most roofers offer free inspections)</li>
        <li>Contact your insurance company within 30 days</li>
        <li>Get at least 2-3 estimates from licensed contractors</li>
        <li>Avoid door-to-door "storm chasers" - verify licenses and references</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Ask for 5-10 recent references in your area. Call them and ask about quality, timeline, and professionalism.</p>

      <h2>3. What's Included in Written Estimate?</h2>
      <p>Demand itemized quotes specifying materials, labor, timeline, and warranties.</p>

      <h2>4. What Permits Are Required?</h2>
      <p>Contractor should pull permits and handle inspections - included in price.</p>

      <h2>5. What's Your Workmanship Warranty?</h2>
      <p>Minimum 5 years, prefer 10+ years written warranty on installation.</p>

      <h2>Red Flags to Avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Demanding large upfront payment (over 25%)</li>
        <li>No written contract</li>
        <li>Can't provide insurance proof</li>

      <p>Roofing warranties are confusing - full of fine print and exclusions. Here's what's actually covered.</p>

      <h2>Types of Warranties</h2>
      
      <h3>Manufacturer's Material Warranty</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Covers manufacturing defects, not installation errors</li>
        <li>Typically 25-30 years, but prorated after 10 years</li>
        <li>Labor costs often NOT included</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Workmanship Warranty</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>From contractor, covers installation errors</li>
        <li>Usually 1-10 years</li>
        <li>Only valid if contractor stays in business</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Understanding Prorated Coverage</h2>
      <p>"30-year warranty" often means full coverage for 10 years, then you pay increasing percentages. A 15-year-old roof with defects might only get 50% coverage.</p>

      <h2>What's NOT Covered</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Wind or hail damage (that's insurance)</li>
        <li>Improper ventilation effects</li>
        <li>Algae/moss growth</li>
        <li>Normal color fading</li>
        <li>Foot traffic damage</li>

        <li>10-15% cooling cost reduction</li>
        <li>Only $0.50-1.00 more per sq ft</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Color Selection Impact</h2>
      <ul>

      <p>Repair or replace? Use this framework to make the right financial decision.</p>

      <h2>The 50% Rule</h2>
      <p>If repair costs exceed 50% of replacement cost, replace instead.</p>

      <h2>Age-Based Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>0-10 years:</strong> Repair unless catastrophic damage</li>
        <li><strong>10-15 years:</strong> Evaluate repair cost vs remaining life</li>
        <li><strong>15-20 years:</strong> Lean toward replacement</li>
        <li><strong>20+ years:</strong> Replace (exceeded expected life)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Replace Immediately If:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Active leaks in multiple locations</li>
        <li>Sagging or soft spots</li>
        <li>Damage affecting 30%+ of roof</li>
        <li>Structural rot discovered</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Repair Makes Sense If:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Roof under 15 years old</li>
        <li>Damage localized (under 100 sq ft)</li>
        <li>Single incident, not pattern of failures</li>

      <p>Your roof is your home's first defense against Texas heat. The right choices can cut cooling costs 20-30%.</p>

      <h2>Surface Temperature by Material</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Black asphalt:</strong> 180-190°F</li>
        <li><strong>White asphalt:</strong> 140-150°F</li>
        <li><strong>White metal:</strong> 120-130°F</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Most Energy-Efficient Materials</h2>

      <h3>1. White Metal Roofing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>60-70% solar reflectance</li>
        <li>$400-800 annual savings</li>
        <li>ROI: 15-25 years</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Cool-Roof Shingles</h3>
